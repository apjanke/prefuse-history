<p>Utility classes for supporting prefuse data structures, including
indexes, iterables, filters, and column projections.</p>

<p>Indexes ({@link prefuse.data.util.Index}) support efficient access to
table rows organized by the data values of a particular column.</p>

<p>Filtered Iterables support selecting subsets of data from data tables.
This includes optimized queries over table rows (using available indexes).
Currently all query planning is performed by the
{@link prefuse.data.util.FilterIterableFactory} class.
</p>

<p>Column Projections filter out unwanted table columns, controlling what
data fields are inherited by a {@link prefuse.data.CascadedTable}.</p>
